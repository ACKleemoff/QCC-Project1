            <h1>Iceland</h1>
            <p><em>Iceland</em> is a country of sharp contrast. A place where fire and ice co-exist. Where dark winters are offset by summer's midnight sun. A country where insular existence has spurred a rich and vibrant culture.</p>

            <p>The Aurora Borealis takes its name from the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora, and the Greek name for north wind, Boreas. From September to April, Iceland is a hotspot for this magnificent lightshow.<br /> The Aurora Borealis, more commonly referred to as the Northern Lights is a natural phenomenon created when particles emitted by the sun interact with the atmosphere in the Earth's magnetic field. this releases energy, causing peculiar luminous green streaks across the skies.</p>

    <div class="northern glacier">
        <p>When making a trip to Iceland, it is hard to pay special attention to the country's namesake --namely, its 4,500 square miles of glacier. Ice climbing on the glaciers is practiced year-round and takes place mainly on the Solheimajokull and Svinafellsjokull glaciers in the south of Iceland, to which day trips are offered from Reykjavik (and Skaftafell).</p>
